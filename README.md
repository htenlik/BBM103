**Assignment 2**
A Python program to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using *backtracking* and *priority-based* rules. Reads input from a file, solves step-by-step, and logs the solution process to an output file.

**Assignment 3**
A Python game where players clear adjacent matching cells in a grid. The grid updates dynamically, and the score is calculated based on cleared cells.

**Assignment 4**
A Python program that solves logical puzzles by filling a grid based on specific constraints. It uses strong *backtracking* to find solutions.

**Q3**
Basic python practices.

**Q4**
A Python program implementing *Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort* algorithms, with intermediate steps written to output files.

**Q6**
Basic python practices.

**Q7**
A python program implementing a calculator that process mathematical expressions and *handling errors*.

**Q8**
A python program implementing fibonnacci numbers with *eager* and *naive* solution.
